\section*{The Degree}
\begin{definition}[Degree]
	Let $n \geq 1$ and $f : \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$ continuous. Then since $H_n(\mathbb{S}^n)$ is infinite cyclic, there is a unique integer $\deg f$ such that $H_n(f)$ is the multiplication by $\deg f$. This integer is called the \bld{degree of $f$}.
\end{definition}
